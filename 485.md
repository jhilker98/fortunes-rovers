**Earl Roderick** married **Lady Ellen** and celebrate their wedding feast at Easter Court, but **Duke Gorlois** was noticeably absent. Roderick understood that Gorlois needed to defend his lands from the **Irish** and thus could not afford to attend every feast or send knights to every battle, unlike **Salisbury**, and Roderick worried that this could force **King Uther** against Gorlois in the future. **Prince Madoc** announced that they would fight **King Ã†lle of Sussex** instead of the newly landed Saxon **King Aethelswith**. This upset all the nobility of the **Saxon Shore**, including **Lady Pomponia** and **Sir Heorot**. Later, the Logres army met the Sussex forces at **Silchester**, and the battle seemed to be going well until a contingent of giants attacked. **Tyfid** heroically died landing a major blow to a giant. That winter, **Helmut** built a statue of Tyfid in his honor.
