**King Cadwy**, the "Magician King" and King of Summerland, refused to trade ore to Logres, so **King Uther** ordered an invasion. To help **Abel** win **Rosalyn**, the player-knights, **Prince Madoc**, and **Nomen** (Helmut's bastard brother) tried to take a castle overseen by one **Sir Cedric**. Instead, they killed Cedric for glory, but Helmut's imposter brother Nomen stabbed Helmut in hopes of usurping his title. After delivering their prisoners and plunder and **Freydis** reporting their deeds, the heroes stayed in the fort with the unconscious Helmut. Cadwy eventually parleyed with Uther and surrendered but maintained his title as count/king of Summerland. After the battle, **Count Roderick** sent the heroes to court **Lady Lylla**, but things went sourly, so he settled on courting **Lady Ellen** the following year. Meanwhile, Helmut searched for Nomen to get revenge but did not find him.
