Rumors of war brewed during the Easter Feast since the **King of Bedegraine** refused to pay **Aurelius's** outstanding tribute to **King Uther** on the grounds that Uther was not High King. After the Easter Feast, **Count Roderick** sent the PKs to meet and court **Lady Rosalyn**. **Freydis** befriended Rosalyn, but **Abel** fell for her, managing to spend time with her thanks to Helmut. During their report to Roderick, Abel kept his feelings for Rosalyn a secret. Later that year, Uther ordered the pillaging of Bedegraine, but the knights chose not to participate, so they hid in the forest. There they found **Sir Sulien** crossing the river to flank his own king. The battle ended in the king of Bedegraine's death, and Uther then made Sulien Count Bedegraine, also giving him the Castle of the Shining Stream in **Jagent**, which greatly angered the **Picts**. Unfortunately, **Duke Gorlois** arrived late to the battle due to bad weather, greatly angering Uther. That winter, a man named **Nomen** showed up to Helmut and **Lothar's** estate, claiming to be Lothar's bastard son and Helmut's older brother. Helmut embraced his new brother eagerly.
