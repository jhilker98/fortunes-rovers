Saxons invaded Salisbury, so **High King Aurelius Ambrosius** and **Earl Roderick of Salisbury** rallied knights to defend it. The battle started going poorly when Aurelius was killed of poisoning, but **Duke Gorlois of Cornwall** brought reinforcements, ending in a decisive victory for Logres. Gorlois then knighted the player-knightsâ€”**Helmut, Abel, Tyfid, and Freydis** personally, and Aurelius's brother **Uther** became King of Logres. At his coronation feast, he named **Madoc**, his bastard son, Prince of Logres. Also during the feast, Tyfid challenged **Sir Sulien**, a knight of Bedegraine, to a drinking contest.
