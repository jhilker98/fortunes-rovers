The hunt for **Nomen** led the knights to hearing of a masked man in **Malahaut** who paid a Saxon raiding party to attack. The heroes captured one of the Saxons, a man named **Baenstan**, who claimed he could recognize the masked man's voice. The knights then went to Lonazep for Easter Court, where they learned about **Lucius**, the 4-year old boy heir to a Saxon duke, who was being raised by his aunt **Baroness Pomponia**, who had paid **King Uther** a large sum of money. They also learned that **Sir Sulien** was engaged to **Lady Rosalyn**. King Uther wanted to hang Baenstan, but the knights pleaded that they still needed him to find Nomen. 

The knights headed north to Malahaut with Baenstan, where they found themselves in the Saxon territory called the **Land of the Dog**. **The Clan of the Dog** captured Nomen and offered him to **King Octa of Nohaut**. **Tyfid**, **Abel**, and **Helmut** literally tumbled into the middle of the exchange and claimed they came as allies, but the Clan of the Dog summoned four spirit dogs to eat them along with Nomen. **Freydis** and her pet wolf intervened:

"Four dogs have been summoned, and four dogs have been spread," said a priest of the Clan sacrificing the boys.

Freydis gestured to Nomen. "He has four limbs, does he not?" 

The dogs killed Nomen, and the knights freed Baenstan, who pointed out the masked man as a person standing next to King Octa. 

The knights split up to investigate. Sulien arrived and confessed to Abel that his betrothal to Rosalyn was a marriage of public appearances because he was gay, and he offered Abel to opportunity to sleep with Rosalyn to sire Sulien's children. Freydis and Baenstan followed the masked man into the forest and found a symbol of **Yggdrasil**. Helmut and Tyfid found King Octa's soldiers preparing to invade Eburacum, and they reported it to Uther.
