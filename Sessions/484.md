In the new year, **Sir Sulien** married **Rosalyn**, and **Abel** tried to get over her by flirting with **Lady Alice**, sister to **Sir Stefan**, who accompanied the PKs the previous year to the north. Some of **King Uther's** citizens had grown malcontent with his rule, such as **Lord Durwin of Clarence** who saw parallels between **Uther** and **Lady Pomponia** with **High King Vortigern** and his Saxon allies. The **Jagent Picts** also had complaints for Uther's maltreatment of them. However, **Tyfid** sends a letter to **King Lot**, convincing the **Lothian Picts** to help Uther fight **King Octa** at **Eburacum**. Everyone marched north except **Duke Gorlois**, and Uther's army nearly lost in an ambush. Sulien was wounded, but Abel stayed to protect him, not wanting to widow Rosalyn, and they were both captured by Octa's Saxons. **Freydis** crossed weapons with **Baenstan**, who turned against his fellow Saxons for her. **Helmut**, Tyfid, and Freydis later discovered a twisted tree that was actually **Merlin** (I've been gone for four years and you all get into such a mess!"), who healed all the Logres knights, allowing Uther to lead another charge. Lot's Picts also arrived, and the two armies pincered Octa between them. Uther spread the word that he had powerful allies (Merlin, Lot, and **King Malahaut**), making him a formidable warlord. The knights then inherited their own manors, Freydis married Baenstan, and Abel married Alice.
